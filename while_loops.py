# 1. Create a while loop that counts from 5 to 25 inclusive, incrementing by 5, and prints each number.
count = 5

# 2. Write a while loop to print all odd numbers between 1 and 19 inclusive. 
count = 1

count = 50
while count >= 0:

# 4. Construct a while loop that starts at 2 and doubles the number each time until it reaches or exceeds 64, printing each result.
count = 2
while count < 64:
    print(count)

# 5. Implement a while loop to iterate from 100 down to 80 inclusive, counting down by 4, and output each number.
